/*
* 1. Make title optional
* 2. Make title multi type support ie: (string, node, react element)
* 3. Add child route support
* */


/*
* Route config object supports all react-router's route component props with some additional props ie: (title, permission, children)
* you can add or remove props from config object it's means it is super customizable and support upto N nesting, child routes must follow the same parent shape,
* it means the config object is same for both there is no additional key for child nor for parent.
* you can find route props from here https://reactrouter.com/web/api/Route let's take a look at some additional props
* 1. permission: permission is an optional prop and it's type is an array of roles, permission is used for allowing certain users/roles
*  	to have access of that route and if you skip/omit the permission or it's an empty array that means every authenticated user/role have access to that route.
* 2. title: title is an optional prop and it's type is a string|node it is used for mapping route link into a navigation
* 3. children: children is also an optional prop and it's type is an array of route config objects, children are used for nested routes
